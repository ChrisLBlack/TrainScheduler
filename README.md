# TrainScheduler

This is a project I completed to familiarize myself with data-base storage and uses a FireBase data-base.  I've also used the moment.js library to handle some of the time related problems in this assignment.

The app takes user inputed data and pushes it to a data-base.  The program then retrieves it, compares the time that the orginal train left, takes in consideration the frequency of the train in minutes, and compares it to the current time.  The app then posts when the next train will arrive.  All of the data in the table is saved to the data-base and is appended to the page via JavaScript.
